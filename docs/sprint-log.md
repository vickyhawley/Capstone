# Sprint log

One entry per sprint. Assessed as evidence of the improvement curve — do
not rewrite past entries.

## Sprint 0 — scaffold (this repo)

### Goal
Deployable skeleton: web shell + API health + SSE stream verified end to
end, CI green, port interfaces defined, ADR-0001 opened.

### Shipped
- Repo, workspace, CI, ports, adapters (stubs), migration 001, ADR-0001
  (decision deferred), README, deploy path.

### Didn't ship
- Anything Sprint 1+.

### Eval delta
- N/A — no eval harness yet.

### Decisions / ADRs
- ADR-0001: hybrid retrieval — decision deferred pending Sprint 1
  measurement.

### Follow-ups carried
- Wire real adapters as their stories land.
- Populate `evals/results/` from Sprint 1.

## Sprint 1 prep — corrections + eval harness

### Goal
Correct six defects surfaced in the Sprint 0 review, add the eval
harness skeleton, and close GW-09 (public URL live).

### Backlog change — GW-37 added to a frozen backlog
Scope was frozen at 36 stories at the start of Sprint 0. GW-37 (per-IP
rate limiting on the API, Upstash Redis) was added mid-week-one. This is
recorded here so the change is visible against the "frozen backlog" rule.

**Why the rule was bent.** The Sprint 0 review flagged that the
LanguageModel adapter lands in Sprint 1 behind a public, unauthenticated
endpoint. Once that adapter is real, every request costs money to a
paid API. Retrofitting rate limiting after the first bill would be
worse than adding a story now. The alternative — leaving the endpoint
unrated until Sprint 2 — has an unbounded downside (spend, abuse) and
zero benefit. This is a week-one correction to Sprint 0's scope, not a
week-nine feature addition, and the distinction matters: a discovered
Sprint-0 defect should land in Sprint 1 prep, not compete for the
backlog with Sprint 3 features.

**How this stays honest.** No further mid-sprint backlog additions
without an equivalent entry in this log. GW-37 counts against the "36
stories" number: the board is now 37 and the graded submission will
report the change here rather than paper over it.

### Shipped
- GW-37: rate limiting middleware (Upstash Redis), fail-closed in prod.
- GW-09: API deployed to Vercel — <https://groundwork-api.vercel.app>.
  Health at `/api/health` returns 200 with `rateLimit.configured: true`.
- Filtered vector search strategy chosen (F2, over-fetch + fallback);
  ADR-0001 updated.
- `ts_rank` correction — sparse index note in ADR-0001 (it is not BM25).
- Fusion method folded into Sprint 1 experiment as a 2×3 grid with
  reranker.
- Embedding model committed (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims) with a
  migration-cost paragraph so a future swap is a considered decision.
- Migration 001 adds GIN on `chunks.metadata` for the F2 filter path.
- Eval harness skeleton (`evals/` Python package), three fixture cases
  clearly marked as harness self-test, evals.yml wired to the harness.

### Didn't ship
- Web app deployment (tracked as GW-09b, next). Requires
  `apps/web/vercel.json` already points at the deployed API — deploy
  is mechanical once the URL is stable, which it now is.

### Eval delta
- N/A — harness ships this sprint; first real numbers land in Sprint 1
  proper.

### Decisions / ADRs
- ADR-0001 revised (filtered search, ts_rank, fusion grid, embedding
  commitment, migration cost).

### Follow-ups carried
- Real answer endpoint on the API so the harness can score more than
  "endpoint not implemented" — Sprint 1.
- Real 40-case dataset (authored separately) — Sprint 1.
- ADR-0002 through ADR-0005 as identified in ADR-0001 follow-ups.
